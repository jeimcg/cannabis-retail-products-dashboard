# Cannabis Retail Products Dashboard in Excel using Slicer, Pivot Tables, Formulas, and Charts

In this project, I located a dataset on data.gov for a dispensary specializing in adult-use and medicinal use to clean, format, pre-process and do exploratory data analysis on using charts, formulas, and pivot tables. 

After creating several charts, I then created a dynamic dashboard using Slicer, where you can zero in on specific products as well as the market (Adult-Use vs. Medicinal) and the month the sale(s) were made from 1/1/23 - 2/1/24.

In my .xlsx file, you will see that the first page is the dataset in its original downloaded form. The second page is when it has been formatted, cleaned, and validated before it is used for any real data analysis. The third page is dedicated to my charts and insights, and the last and final page is for my dashboard complete with dynamic elements!

## Findings

- [Adult Use] I wonder if people bought more carts and in November and December as opposed to any other months due to the chillier weather forcing smokers inside?

- [Adult Use] I wonder if instead of the cold, it might be because of the numerous holidays and families that are more likely to be together. People might cut back on their flower usage more than anything for reasons related to the smell, fear of judgement, being around kids, things of that sort and nature.

- [Adult Use] Even edibles have a slight but noticeable increase in sales around this time as well furthering my hypothesis that the uptick in these non-combustible forms of cannabis is due to family and holidays, at least, moreso than inclement weather.

- [Medicinal] With regards to edibles, extracts, and other forms of cannabis, we could reduce the inventory of these if we really needed to in order to make room for more valuable or sought after product. While these products do bring in profit, it is nowhere near as much profit as seen with flower and vape cartridges which are set way above the first three products examined.

- [Medicinal] As a matter of fact, maybe we could cut down or cut the lesser three of all the products out entirely and focus on procuring better and more valuable product for flower and vape cartridges, adult AND medicinal. This way, we could possibly close the gap on and even surpass previous performance in relation to profit from the lessened inventory making up for the lesser three of the cannabis products in this market!


## Acknowledgements

I would love to thank the wealth of open-minded professors I had regarding drug usage and policy in the US. I would begin to describe them as harm reductionists and I would fall under the beliefs that often make up the idea of harm reduction. 

History has show that it's almost human nature to partake in substances from caffeine all the way to methamphetamine and because of this nature, I feel that it's in our best interest to confront the issues, concerns, and conversations surrounding drug use with nuance and knowledge. I was glad I can broach this topic a bit using the hotly debated drug, cannabis!

I also want to thank Diana Shaw for creating and uploading the original dataset for me to work with!
