In this project, I primarily use Excel (Slicer, Pivot Tables, Formulas, Charts) to execute data cleaning, formatting, visualization, and insight generation. I decided to use a dataset from Kaggle to complete this analysis and simply test out what I learned in various stats courses and certification courses.

During my college career, I also took a particular interest in current and past drug policy, substance abuse and misuse, and the history and legality of certain drugs, particularly opiates, MDMA, and cannabis. The lattermost of which has been growing in popularity as many states across the US have started or are already in the throes of legalization or decriminalization in order to be used in therapeutic settings.

In this, I think it’s important we become educated on drug classes and their constituents, mainly cannabis: its history, its uses, its positives, its negatives, and everything in between. More widespread education, in combination with the power of data analysis, can reveal what the true impact of legalization and decriminalization could be on people, our communities, and our local economies.

Given the work I’ve done here, I would venture to say that many states could benefit economically from beginning the process of legalization and decriminalization as the profit is all from a singular store.
